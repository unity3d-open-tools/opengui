### What is it?
It's a GUI framework for Unity that aims to keep things as simple as possible while keeping draw calls to an absolute minimum. I am developing this in tandem with my Deus Ex-based game project <a href="http://mrzapp.github.io/vongott/">The Vongott Chronicles</a>

### Why?
GUI frameworks for Unity are overpriced, and the built-in API is a ridiculous resource hog with every widget requiring one or two draw calls. And we can't expect Unity to provide a decent UI system "sometime in the future", when we are ready to develop games now :) So this framework is using the OpenGL API to render widgets, and trying its best to be simple and easy to use at the same time.

### Notes
- Yes, it does works with C# project  
- It is an open source project developed in the coontributors' spare time  
- It won't cost you anything, but it comes without guarantee
